Guidelines:

	Leverage flexibility and features (like indexing, querying, atomic updates) of mongoDB
	Make sure you put checks and "protections" in your application code for things like relationships.
	Your schema can change as you insert more data.
	The way you use the data is how it should be modeled.
	Use natural primary keys
		For example, user email or username
		One less index
	Basic design principles apply.
	Anticipate document and collection growth over time.

General notes:
		Each document has "schema" data, so make field names short.
		Keep in mind mongoDB doesn't support transactions
			no rollback, no begin and commit
		What is the lifetime of your data?
			Frequent deletes? Possibly leads to fragmentation.
		Embedded docs could have their own ids, but it's up to the application to generate them (and keep them unique)
		No way to get the size of an array, you'd have to cache the size
		Updates don't return the document. Use findAndModify instead.
		Data in mongodb is not necessarily renormalized, just maybe more object-like.

Terminology
		Table - collection
		Row - json document
		Index - Index
		Join - Embedding and Linking


Questions to ask yourself:

	What is your usage pattern of the data?
		Read-friendly approach for many-many
			Save children ids in parent document.
			Writes are slow.
			Sharding is trivial.
			For example, Obama's twitter doc has a list of his followers.
		Write-friendly approach
			Save parent id in child doc.
			Slow reads.  
			For example, db.users.find(following : obama's twitter id)
		Hybrid

	Will you shard your data?
		All docs must contain the shard key
		Shard key values are immutable once the doc is inserted
		Think about how you will query using the shard key
		Make sure sorting by shard key can be efficient
		Unique indexes must be prefixed by the shard key


	Concurrency:
		Try to avoid save() in the drivers.
			Each field is reset and only one document can be updated at a time.
			Use update instead.


Patterns:
	one to many
		Use linking (like a foreign key, but no enforcing of the relationship)
		Embedded document
			If your data will be used at the same time and together
			If you need the embedded data in the same order that the parent docs are sorted
			Performance benefits
		Bucketing
			Separate collection for children, but group into buckets.
			Useful for writing/retrieving related data.
		Which to use?
			Depends on how you will use the data


	Many-to-Many
		Array of parent ids on the child, array of child ids on the parent
			Allows you to leverage multi-key indexes
			Requires application-level maintenance
		Array of parents ids on the child


	Tree
		Store literal structure
			Use if your data is always displayed in this way
			Difficult to search
			16mb limit of a document
				(Moby Dick can be stored in 16mb)
		Keep an array of ancestors
		Keep a string of ancestors, delimited by a character.  
			Use regex in query.
